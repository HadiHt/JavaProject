The transportation network extends beyond to neighboring cities, including Zaprešić, Sesvete, and Velika Gorica, where the Zagreb airport is located. Zagreb is a very walkable city, so one could easily live or visit without a car. Nevertheless, with more than 19 tram lines and 117 buses, ZETs system is extensive. Trams and buses run 24 hours a day, although not all lines run all the time.",
